 <p font-size="14pt" font-weight="bold">Grizzlies and People</p>
 <p font-size="10pt" font-weight="regular">Since the Ice Age, 
    man has feared the great denizens of the north. But why is that?</p>
  <p font-size="12pt" font-weight="bold">Horribleness</p>
  <p font-size="10pt" font-weight="regular">Grizzlies are so horrible, 
    they are named <emph>Ursus horribilis</emph>. 'Nuff said?</p>
  <p font-size="12pt" font-weight="bold">Largeness</p>
  <p font-size="10pt" font-weight="regular">Male grizzlies can average 
    900 pounds and 9 feet tall. That's a lot of bear to feed, and they 
    don't mind a little human in the diet!</p>
  <p font-size="12pt" font-weight="bold">Aggressiveness</p>
  <p font-size="10pt" font-weight="regular">Grizzlies are too large to 
    escape danger by climbing trees; instead, they stand their ground.</p>
  <p font-size="10pt" font-weight="regular">All that being said, 
    humans are still more dangerous than grizzly bears!</p>
