  <title>Grizzlies and People</title>
  <p>Since the Ice Age, man has feared the great denizens of the north. 
    But why is that?</p>
  <section1>
    <title>Horribleness</title>
    <p>Grizzlies are so horrible, they are named <emph>Ursus horribilis</emph>.  
      'Nuff said?</p>
  </section1>
  <section1>
    <title>Largeness</title>
    <p>Male grizzlies can average 900 pounds and 9 feet tall. That's a lot of bear 
      to feed, and they don't mind a little human in the diet!</p>
  </section1>
  <section1>
    <title>Aggressiveness</title>
    <p>Grizzlies are too large to escape danger by climbing trees; instead, they  
      stand their ground.</p>
  </section1> 
  <p>All that being said, humans are still more dangerous than grizzly bears!</p>
