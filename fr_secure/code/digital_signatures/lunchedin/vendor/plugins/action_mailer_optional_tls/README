ActionMailer Optional TLS
=========================

This plugin allows ActionMailer to work with SMTP servers that require TLS.  It is heavily monkeypatched into ActionMailer and Net/SMTP, but such is life. Just set the following, and proceed as usual:

ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings[:tls] = true

I haven't quite figured out the best way to test this plugin, but if you execute the following command, you should receive a gmail from yourself, and a fair amount of debug information will be output.  I hope it suffices; if not, suggest an improvement!

rake EMAIL=my_gmail_account@gmail.com PASSWORD=secret
